### Oiwi Parker Jones
> Principal Investigator

{{< resize_image src="oiwi.png" alt="Oiwi" >}}

Oiwi leads the Parker Jones Neural Processing Lab (PNPL) at the University of Oxford. His aim is to build bridges between deep learning and the brain, for example by accelerating the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), but also by developing deep learning methods for interpreting brain data and leveraging principles of systems neuroscience to inform machine learning. Oiwi completed a DPhil focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages. He further trained as a postdoc in Imaging Neuroscience at UCL and Oxford, and in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the ORI. He was previously a lecturer in Medicine at St Peter's College, Oxford, and is currently Hugh Price Fellow in Computer Science at Jesus College, Oxford.

### Pratik Somaiya
> Software Engineer

{{< resize_image src="pratik.jpg" alt="Pratik" >}}

Pratik joined the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI) in May 2023 as a Robotics Software Engineer. Before that, he pursued an MSc by Research in Robotics at the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems Research (L-CAS), University of Lincoln, UK. Prior to his Master's, he was a Research Assistant at L-CAS working in agri-robotics. Pratik also spent several years in the industry before joining L-CAS. During that time, he worked on developing robots for warehouse material handling and consumer robots such as vacuum cleaning robots.

### Dulhan Jayalath
> PhD Student

{{< resize_image src="dulhan.png" alt="Dulhan" >}}

Dulhan is a DPhil student in the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems (AIMS) CDT. At PNPL, his work focuses on leveraging deep learning to find efficient representations of brain signals for downstream tasks (e.g. phoneme recognition from heard speech brain data). Prior to joining PNPL, he worked on multi-agent RL and reasoning with graph neural networks at the University of Cambridge. Before this, he completed his BSc in Computer Science at the University of Southampton, where he researched computer vision systems for visual navigation. He has worked on large language models at Speechmatics and developing assembly-level machine learning kernels for new hardware at Arm.

### Birtan Demirel
> Research Assistant

{{< resize_image src="birtan.webp" alt="Birtan" >}}

Birtan completed his MSc degree in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences at the University of Pavia, Italy. He also trained at the Neurology Department, University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany, where he used real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for his Master's research project. He is carrying out research for his DPhil at the University of Oxford with Prof. Kate Watkins in the Department of Experimental Psychology, and Prof. Charlotte Stagg at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging and MRC BNDU, funded by a grant from the Dominic Barker Trust. Birtan also teaches neurophysiology at undergraduate level as part of a Graduate Development Scholarship from St. Anne's College, Oxford. Birtan is interested in speech-motor impairments and how acute stress physiology, cognitive functions and emotions affect speech production. He uses transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) alongside advanced neuroimaging techniques of MRI, functional MRI, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results of his studies should inform further neuroimaging studies in stuttering and provide possible therapeutic interventions for people who want to work on their speech fluency.

### Hayley Millard
> Research Assistant

### Daniel Grant
> Visiting Student

{{< resize_image src="daniel.jpg" alt="Daniel" >}}

Daniel is pursuing a dual major in computer science and maths at Bowdoin College (currently studying abroad at St. Annes College, Oxford University for the duration of the 2023-24 academic year). He is fascinated by the intersection of mathematics and computer systems, especially in robotics, aerospace and machine learning.

### Brian Liu
> Visiting Student

{{< resize_image src="brian.jpg" alt="Brian" >}}

Brian is a junior at Bowdoin College studying abroad in Oxford, majoring in mathematics and computer science and minoring in music. He is interested in intersecting mathematical deductions of music, human processes and decisions, and the natural world with programming, as well as leveraging technology to benefit the common good and uncover truths in capital systems.
